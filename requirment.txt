Tips for Project Improvement
1. Technical Structure
Backend:

Use Django (Python) or Node.js for scalability.

Separate databases for user data, resources, and diagnostic results.

Implement API endpoints for your chatbot and diagnosis models.

Frontend:

Use React.js/Vue.js for dynamic UIs (e.g., dashboards).

Ensure accessibility (screen reader compatibility, alt text for images).

2. Security & Privacy
Encrypt user data (e.g., test results, chat history).

Add two-factor authentication (2FA) for professional accounts.

Comply with HIPAA or regional health data laws if storing medical info.

3. User Experience (UX)
Onboarding Tutorial: Guide users through features on first login.

Crisis Mode: Redirect users in distress to hotlines/emergency resources.

Gamification: Reward users with badges for completing self-care tasks.

4. Content Strategy
Partner with mental health experts to validate resources.

Add multilingual support for broader reach.

Use content moderation to keep forums/chatbot interactions safe.

5. Scalability
Use cloud hosting (AWS, Firebase) for traffic spikes.

Modular code structure to add future features (e.g., video counseling).

Example Workflow
A user visits /diagnosis, completes a test, and gets a result.

The chatbot (/chatbot) suggests coping strategies based on the diagnosis.

The user explores /resources to learn about mental health taboos.

They sign up for personal volunteering on /volunteer.

Their progress is tracked on /dashboard.

    "response": "\\nInstruction: You are a highly experienced mental health diagnosis assistant with expertise in psychology and psychiatry. A user will provide a detailed narrative describing their feelings, challenges, symptoms, and history of medications, therapies, or diagnoses. Your task is to:\\n\\n1. Parse the narrative: Extract key details regarding the patient's current state, symptoms, and history.\\n2. Diagnosis: Based solely on the provided narrative, determine the most likely mental health condition(s).\\n3. Reasoning: Provide a clear and concise explanation of your reasoning for each diagnosis, explaining how the symptoms align with the condition.\\n4. Multiple Diagnoses: If more than one diagnosis is possible, list each potential condition along with its corresponding explanation.\\n5. Clarifying Questions: If the narrative lacks sufficient details for a confident diagnosis, ask targeted clarifying questions to gather more information. Maximum of 5 questions.\\n\\nResponse Guidelines:\\n- If symptoms clearly match a condition, provide a diagnosis and reasoning.\\n- If more information is needed, provide only up to 5 clarifying questions.\\n- If no significant symptoms or mental health conditions are detected, respond with:\\n  **\\\"Based on the provided information, your condition appears to be within a normal range. If you have concerns, consulting a professional might be beneficial.\\\"**\\n\\nPatient Narrative: i am feeling sad\\n\\nTake your time to carefully analyze the information before responding.\\n\\nOutput Format:\\n\\nClarifying Questions:\\n- [If applicable, list up to 5 questions]\\n\\nDiagnosis:\\n  - **[Diagnosis Name 1]**: [Reasoning & Explanation]\\n    **Confidence Rate**: [Percentage]\\n\\n  - **[Diagnosis Name 2]**: [Reasoning & Explanation] (if applicable)\\n    **Confidence Rate**: [Percentage]\\n\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAssistant: Clarifying Questions:\\n1. How long have you been feeling sad?\\n2. Is this sadness a new experience or has it been ongoing?\\n3. Are there any specific events or situations that trigger your sadness?\\n4. How does your sadness affect your daily life and activities?\\n5. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with sadness, such as anxiety or irritability?\\n\\nDiagnosis:\\n  - **Major Depressive Disorder**: The patient's description of feeling sad for an unspecified duration suggests a potential diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder. Sadness is a common symptom of depression, and the absence of other specific symptoms makes this diagnosis plausible. However, without more detailed information about the duration, severity, and impact of the sadness, the confidence rate for this diagnosis is moderate (60%).\\n  \\n  - **Bipolar Disorder**: While the patient's description does not provide enough information to rule out Bipolar Disorder, the presence of sadness could be a symptom of a depressive episode in Bipolar Disorder. However, without additional information about mood swings, manic episodes, or other symptoms, the confidence rate for this diagnosis is low (30%).\\n  \\n  - **Adjustment Disorder**: The patient's description of feeling sad could also be indicative of an Adjustment Disorder\"}`;
