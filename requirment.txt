Tips for Project Improvement
1. Technical Structure

Separate databases for user data, resources, and diagnostic results.

Implement API endpoints for your chatbot and diagnosis models.

Frontend:

Use React.js/Vue.js for dynamic UIs (e.g., dashboards).

Ensure accessibility (screen reader compatibility, alt text for images).

2. Security & Privacy
Encrypt user data (e.g., test results, chat history).

Add two-factor authentication (2FA) for professional accounts.

Comply with HIPAA or regional health data laws if storing medical info.

3. User Experience (UX)
Onboarding Tutorial: Guide users through features on first login.

Crisis Mode: Redirect users in distress to hotlines/emergency resources.

Gamification: Reward users with badges for completing self-care tasks.

4. Content Strategy
Partner with mental health experts to validate resources.

Add multilingual support for broader reach.

Use content moderation to keep forums/chatbot interactions safe.

5. Scalability
Use cloud hosting (AWS, Firebase) for traffic spikes.

Modular code structure to add future features (e.g., video counseling).

Example Workflow
